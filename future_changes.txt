This is to help you understand broader picture when designing our next moves. It's not set in stone 
and it should not take precedence over my immediate instructions. We will maybe change some parts along the way,
and also you can add comments on how we implemented each step after we complete it. 
Make sure that all that we do is consistent with previous work, for backend actions see how we split routes 
and services, in future we keep that same style. if youre unsure, read previous code or even BETTER read repomix.

the idea is to add new features for our store:
it will be used by photographers and by traders. what we did so far (before feb 9)
was meant for traders who will only buy and sell NFTs

1) photographers will have another usage on this site. They can go to profile page and get verified.
If they arent verified, they will see a text that explains what verification is and what it's for
and will get a button that will let them start verification process.
On verification page they will enter their desired username, biography, email address
then they will submit verification (that part gets signed as well).
At that time a new record in database is created that ties that hash address with that user info but
its status is UNCONFIRMED

2) Next time when they visit profile page they will see how their info would look like
but they will get a warning that nobody else can see their info yet since the verification process
isnt complete. They need to upload at least one photo if they want to complete verification. The text 
will also say that they can still edit their data before uploading a photo. They will 
also be shown two buttons Edit info and Finish verifying
edit info will take them to page that looks the same as one they initiali entered their data on, and 
they can edit it. If they want to finalize their verification they will pe sent to upload page 

3) Uploading pictures: 
each artist can upload pictures that will be displayed in their portfolio. Once the whole upload is 
completed and admin aproved, the picture will be on ardrive saved and there will be a 
transaction record that will testify that that verified user has uploaded that 
photo. The idea is that they 
will need to gift one NFT part of their choice to admin (we will provide admin hash) and that will be price for
uploading the photo. So on that page they will upload a photo max size 100kb, its name and
description. He then clicks upload, he enters password to sign that, picture and data gets uploaded to server
but its status isnt yet completed, its PENDING. The part that is to be given as a price is then made unavailable
the same way that making a gift would make it unavailable
When admin account is logged in, he can see all pending uploads. We will reuse styling that we use for My transactions 
page to list all pending uploads. for each upload there is a button review where they can see that upload in 
more detail and can either approve or refuse it. if they approve it, we upload the picture to ardrive. 
When upload succeds, there is transaction created, so admin recieves that one Part thet was selected as payment 
for upload, new transaction is created on backend and uploaded to arweave like we usually do, its type is UPLOAD, it has some 
extra fields like url of uploaded image (not to be confused with image url that is url of Part picture).
If it's first upload of that user, there are some additional fields set like isVerificationConfirmation=True 
and fields with info of that verification (username, bio, email).
