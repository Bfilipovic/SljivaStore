<!-- 
  ❌ ISSUE #1: Generic NFT description doesn't reflect fractionalized parts
  ✅ SUGGESTION: Clarify that the platform deals with fractionalized NFT parts
-->
NFTs are the evidence of physical asset in the digital world that can be bought and sold like any other piece of property, issued via Blockchain.


<!-- 
  ❌ ISSUE #2: States "only buy and sell Collectibles using ETH" - INCORRECT
  ✅ ACTUAL: Platform supports both ETH and SOL cryptocurrencies
  ✅ SUGGESTION: "users can buy and sell NFT parts using the cryptocurrencies Ether (ETH) or Solana (SOL)"
-->
The Platform is built on top of the Ethereum network and users can only buy and sell Collectibles using the cryptocurrency Ether ("ETH"). No fiat money is stored or handled by the Platform at any point.


<!-- 
  ❌ ISSUE #3: Definition is too generic - doesn't mention fractionalized parts
  ✅ ACTUAL: Platform tracks individual parts of NFTs, not just whole NFTs
  ✅ SUGGESTION: "NFT Parts" means fractionalized portions of NFTs, each tracked by unique identifiers and transaction hashes, deployed to the Ethereum and Solana blockchains.
-->


"NFTs" means the tokens with string constant public presence, which are tracked by the Txn Hash, deployed to the Ethereum Blockchain.
<!-- 
  ⚠️ PARTIAL ISSUE: Should clarify it's about parts, not whole NFTs
  ✅ SUGGESTION: "Peer-to-peer transactions allow you to freely trade your NFT parts..."
-->


Peer-to-peer transactions, allow you freely trade your assets by NFTs, without a bank or financial institution intermediary.
<!-- 
  ❌ ISSUE #4: Describes whole NFTs, but platform deals with fractionalized parts
  ✅ ACTUAL: Users trade individual parts of NFTs, which can be owned by multiple users
  ✅ SUGGESTION: "NFT Parts are fractionalized portions of NFTs, allowing multiple users to own different parts of the same NFT."
-->


NFTs are intended to be "non-fungible" tokens representing a unique Collectible. 
<!-- 
  ❌ ISSUE #5: Mentions "accounts on the NFTs Apps" - doesn't reflect mnemonic-based auth
  ✅ ACTUAL: Platform uses mnemonic phrase authentication, not traditional accounts
  ✅ SUGGESTION: "Users are responsible for all matters relating to their mnemonic phrases and the blockchain accounts or addresses (ETH and SOL) through which they interact with the Platform. Your mnemonic phrase is encrypted and stored locally in your browser - it never leaves your device."
-->


Users are responsible for all matters relating to their accounts on the NFTs Apps or the ETH blockchain accounts or addresses through which they interact with the Offerings.
<!-- 
  ❌ ISSUE #6: Mentions "login information" and "private keys" - should mention mnemonics
  ✅ ACTUAL: Platform uses 12-word mnemonic phrases for authentication
  ✅ SUGGESTION: "Users are responsible for protecting the confidentiality of their mnemonic phrases (12-word recovery phrases) that control their blockchain accounts or addresses through which they interact with the Platform. IMPORTANT: Your mnemonic phrase never leaves your browser - it is encrypted and stored locally, never transmitted to our servers."
-->


Users are responsible for protecting the confidentiality of their login information for the NFTs Apps or the private keys controlling the relevant blockchain accounts or addresses through which they interact with the Offerings.
<!-- 
  ⚠️ PARTIAL ISSUE: Should clarify ownership of parts vs whole NFTs
  ✅ SUGGESTION: "All NFT parts you own on the Platform belong to you. What's yours is yours — you own your parts."
-->

  ⚠️ PARTIAL ISSUE: Should mention parts specifically, not just "Collectibles"
  ✅ SUGGESTION: "Users must not create, buy, sell, gift, or use any NFT part or Collectible that infringes..."
-->
