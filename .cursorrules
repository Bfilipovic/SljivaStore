# Cursor AI Rules for SljivaStore Project

## Context Source Priority

**ALWAYS check repomix first before reading individual files!**

1. **Primary Source**: Check `orch_ai_strator/context/repomix-output.xml` first for code context
   - This file contains a compressed representation of the entire codebase
   - It's much more token-efficient than reading individual files
   - Only read actual files when you need to make edits or repomix doesn't have enough detail

2. **Secondary Source**: Use `codebase_search` for semantic searches if repomix doesn't answer

3. **Tertiary Source**: Only read individual files (`read_file`) when:
   - You need to make edits
   - Repomix doesn't contain the specific code you need
   - You need exact formatting/indentation

## Token Efficiency

- **Prefer repomix** - It's already generated and cached
- **Avoid redundant file reads** - Check repomix first to see if the code exists there
- **Use codebase_search** - For finding patterns across the codebase without reading files

## Workflow

1. User asks a question or requests a change
2. Check `orch_ai_strator/context/repomix-output.xml` for context (if it exists)
3. If repomix has the info → use it
4. If repomix doesn't have enough detail → use `codebase_search`
5. Only read actual files when you need to edit them or repomix/codebase_search isn't sufficient

This workflow applies to **ALL prompts**, regardless of whether `@orchestrate` is used or not.

## Core Principles

- Always prioritize repomix for context gathering
- Only read files when absolutely necessary (for edits or missing detail)
- This saves significant tokens and improves response speed
